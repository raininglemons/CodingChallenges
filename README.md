# CodingChallenges

Solutions to a number of coding challenges on CodeEval and AdventOfCode.

These code snippets are written in javascript and are executed with NodeJS. Unless otherwise stated, they are all executed with the command;

> node server.js test

With the `test` file formatted as plain text with the input for the challenge.

### Usage
These solutions are not definitive and are just my interpretation of a suitable answer to a given challenge. They are to be used as a guide, and not as a source of copy and pasting to achieve points on the challenging sites.
